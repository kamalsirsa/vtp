<blockquote>

<p>The VTP Content Manager (CManager) is a useful tool for organizing, categorizing,
and preparing your 3d models for use with the VTP software environment.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Load and view your models interactively to see how they will look in the
    virtual world.</li>
  <li>Organize multiple models representing levels of detail of the same object
    into a single conception 'Item'.</li>
  <li>Classify your items with high-level attributes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Use</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Put your models anywhere you like on your Data path.&nbsp; Here are
    some recommended locations:
    <ul>
      <li>Buildings: <code>Data/BuildingModels</code></li>
      <li>Plants: <code>Data/PlantModels</code></li>
      <li>Vehicles: <code>Data/Vehicles</code></li>
      <li>all other culture: <code>Data/Culture</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Run CManager</li>
  <li>Create an Item for each object you have modelled.</li>
  <li>Give each Item a name (e.g. &quot;1975 Ford Bronco&quot;) and a type (e.g.
    &quot;sports utility vehicle&quot;).&nbsp; You can optionally add any other
    attributes that you want, here, by adding Tags.</li>
  <li>To each Item, add a Model.&nbsp; You can either use &quot;Add Model&quot;
    and browse to your file, or drag-and-drop files from the Windows
    Explorer.&nbsp; If the Models were created with units other than meters, you can set
    the scale factor for each one.</li>
  <li>If you have several levels of detail, add more Models to the Item and set
    the &quot;Visible at distance&quot; field for each Model.&nbsp; This is the 
  farthest distance at which the model is visible.&nbsp; If you only have a 
  single model, you can leave this distance at &quot;0&quot;.&nbsp; You should add your 
  models in order from most detailed to least detailed.</li>
  <li>When you have added all your Items, save the Content file (.vtco file 
  extension)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>If you need more control over your content than CManager gives you, you can 
  also simply edit your Content file by hand, as it is a simple XML format.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>CManager is &quot;in beta&quot; and the documentation is still very small.<br>
However, you may find most features to be self-explanatory.<br>
