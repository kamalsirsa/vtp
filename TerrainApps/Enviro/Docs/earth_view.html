<h2>Earth View</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>At startup, select &quot;Earth View&quot; and press OK.&nbsp; You are now
  viewing the planet from space.</p>

  <h4>How to Navigate:</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>To spin the viewpoint around the earth, hold down the <b>right </b>mouse
      button.</li>
    <li>To zoom in and out, use the <b>shift key</b> and the <b>right </b>mouse
      button to drag up and down.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each known terrain area will be shown as a small red rectangle on the
  earth.&nbsp; To switch to a terrain, just click within its rectangle with the <b>left</b> 
  mouse button, which will take you to <a href="terrain_view.html">Terrain View</a>.</p>
  <h4>Menu Commands for Earth View:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Earth - <b>Show Shading</b><ul>
        <li>Shows the earth illuminated by
      sunlight based on real, current time and date, according to your computer's clock.&nbsp; 
        Alternately, you can show the earth fully illuminated with no shading.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Earth - <b>Show Axes</b><ul>
        <li>Toggles the display of some informative lines in space:<br>
        Yellow arrow shows direction of light from the sun,<br>
        Green vertical axis is the earth's axis of rotation,<br>
        Red vertical axis is perpendicular to the plane of the earth's orbit,<br>
        Green array shows the direction of the earth's motion around the sun. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Earth - <b>Seasonal Tilt</b><ul>
    <li>Toggles whether the tilt of the earth's axis due to day of the year 
    should be applied</li>
  </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Earth - <b>Flatten</b><ul>
    <li>Toggles flattening of the earth into an Icosahedron - mainly useful to 
    illustrate the icosahedral projection used to texture-map the globe evenly</li>
  </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Earth - <b>Unfold</b><ul>
    <li>Toggles the unfolding and flattening of the earth into the Dymaxion 
    projection (<b>Flat Earth View</b>)</li>
  </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Earth - <b>Add Point Data</b> 
      <ul>
        <li>Allows you to display a set of point data
      (from a Shapefile) on the Earth as small yellow points.</li>
        <li>Try the file <b>Data/PointData/vtp-users.shp</b> to see the
          locations of the first 2260 VTP recipients.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Earth - <b>Add Linear Features</b><ul>
    <li>Allows you to trace, one at a time, linear features on the globe.&nbsp; 
    Geodesic distance is displayed in the status bar.&nbsp; This is useful for 
    illustrating shortest-path routes on the earth.</li>
  </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Flat Earth View</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>When the earth is unfolded (with Earth: Unfold) it is displayed in the 
  Dymaxion projection.&nbsp; In this view, navigation is different:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the Right mouse button to Pan</li>
    <li>Use <b>both</b> the Right and Left mouse buttons together to Zoom</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Currently, point data is displayed in both the regular and flat earth 
  views.</p>
