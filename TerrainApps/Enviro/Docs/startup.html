<h3>Startup Dialog</h3>

  <blockquote>
    This simple dialog is the first thing you see when you launch Enviro.&nbsp; 
    There are a few things you can do:<ul>
      <li>Choose which image to use to texture-map the earth in Earth View.</li>
      <li>Choose which terrain to view in Terrain View.</li>
      <li>Edit the <a href="terrain_creation.html">terrain properties</a> of the 
      selected terrain.</li>
      <li>Open the Terrain Manager dialog (below).</li>
      <li>Set a few Global Options, including:<ul>
        <li>Full Screen<ul>
          <li>Enviro will attempt to open a full-screen window, with only the 
          toolbar added to the immersive 3D experience.&nbsp; You can also 
          toggle this at any time after the main window opens, with the &quot;View - 
          Fullscreen&quot; menu, or Ctrl-F.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Set Size Exaggeration for Plants and Fences<ul>
          <li>This will affect any terrain you open in Terrain View, and can be 
          useful for working with large areas where these culture features are 
          often small and hard to see.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Check your OpenGL Info<ul>
          <li>This is a good thing to check the first time you run Enviro on a 
          new machine, to troubleshoot issues with your 3D card and driver, and 
          to learn the largest texture your system can handle.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>
  
<h3>Terrain Manager Dialog</h3>
<blockquote>
  From this dialog, you can:<ul>
    <li>Add and remove paths from your <a href="data_path.html">Data Path</a></li>
    <li>Create and delete terrains.&nbsp; The best (and only) way to create a 
    new terrain is to copy an existing one.&nbsp; You can then Edit Parameters 
    of the new terrain, including giving it a new name.</li>
  </ul>
